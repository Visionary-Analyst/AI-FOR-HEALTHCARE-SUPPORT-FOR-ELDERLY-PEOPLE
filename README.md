# 2. AI SOLUTION - THEORETICAL ASPECT
# 2.1	Machine Learning Approach (Supervised Learning)
# 2.1.1 Task: Fall Detection
Here's why supervised learning is appropriate for this task:
•	Supervised Learning: Fall detection typically involves predicting whether a fall has occurred or not based on sensor data (features). In supervised learning, you train the model on a labeled dataset, where each data point is associated with a fall or non-fall label. This allows the model to learn the patterns associated with falls and make predictions on new, unlabeled data.
•	Dataset: We will need a dataset with historical sensor data from smart devices (e.g. accelerometers, gyroscopes) worn by elderly individuals. This dataset should include labels indicating whether a fall occurred during each data point (e.g., "fall" or "no fall").
•	Random Forest Classifier: We used Random Forest classifier and  experiment with other classification algorithms based on our dataset's characteristics.
•	Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy and a classification report to assess precision, recall, and F1-score for fall detection.
•	Classification Algorithms: We used classification for identifying health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, or fall detection.
•	Logistic Regression
•	Random Forest
•	Support Vector Machines (SVM)
# 2.1.2	Data
•	Data Articulation: In our AI solution for healthcare support for elderly individuals, we have meticulously articulated the data requirements. The dataset includes fields such as Name, Age, Gender, Email, Address, Time-in, and Time-out. Each of these fields serves a specific purpose in providing comprehensive healthcare support.
•	Relevant Data:
•	Name: While not used directly for analysis, the name field helps in personalizing communication and healthcare recommendations for elderly individuals.
•	Age: Age is a fundamental demographic variable. It is relevant for understanding the unique healthcare needs of elderly individuals and tailoring healthcare recommendations based on age groups.
•	Gender: Gender can influence health conditions and healthcare needs. It allows us to provide gender-specific health guidance.
•	Email: Email addresses enable digital communication, appointment reminders, and access to online health resources.
•	Address: Address data is important for ensuring healthcare services are accessible and for identifying local healthcare facilities.
